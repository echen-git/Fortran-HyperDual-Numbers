# Fortran-HyperDual-Numbers
This is a Summer internship project I worked on with the help of Professor Capps.
Hyperdual numbers are a higher-dimensional extension of dual numbers. 
They are used for calculating derivatives without subtractive-cancellation and truncation error.
They can produce exact derivatives without the need of searching for an optimal step size.
They can be applied to Computational Fluid Dynamics(CFD)
