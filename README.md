# Fortran-HyperDual-Numbers
This is a Summer internship project I worked on with the help of Professor Capps.

The goal was to create a Fortran implementation of Hyperdual numbers based on the C++ implementation by Jeffrey Fike and Juan J Alonso

Hyperdual Numbers

-used for calculating derivatives without subtractive-cancellation and truncation error

-can produce exact derivatives without the need of searching for an optimal step size

-can be applied to Computational Fluid Dynamics(CFD)
